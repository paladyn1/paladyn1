- 👋 Hi, I’m @paladyn1
- 👀 I’m interested in Node.JS, MongoDB, DevOps stuff like Terraform and Helm.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN stack, Node.JS in particular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... anything really.  I could use the practice.
- 📫 How to reach me - Um...  trying to figure out how I want the messages to come in.  I'll update this.
